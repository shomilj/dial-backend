# Feeds - Backend API

This is the Backend API for [Feeds, an open-sourced App Store for algorithmic choice.](https://github.com/shomilj/feeds-react-native/)

This project is very much a proof-of-concept; it uses [Twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint), and not the official Twitter API, to scrape tweets from Twitter - and thus, is somewhat unreliable, especially when deployed to Google Cloud Functions.
